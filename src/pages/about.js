            <p>Hi and welcome to my little web corner. This is an unpretentious dump space for my thoughts, feelings, ideias and ocasional doodles and pictures.</p>
            <p>I was born in 86 and grew up in a long gone era when we used dial-up cord phones, went to the public library and used actual encyclopedias 
                to do our homework. I first went online when ICQ was popping all over the place and many kids memorized long UIN numbers to share with friends so we could
                chat online. Were those better times? Who am I to judge? I just know that I miss the age of the uncentralized web, filled with geocities fansites.
            </p>
            <p>I dedicate this little website to those nostalgic days.</p>
